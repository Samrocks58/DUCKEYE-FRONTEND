# DuckEye - Find Your Vision Through Our Eyes

## What is DuckEye?

For the ADP sponsor prompt, we wanted to create an accessible and simple tech solution for all work related questions or issues. DuckEye is a smart AI assistant career coach, available to help whenever to provide career guidance and to answer occupational questions. DuckEye is integrated with Indeed to provide a large net of available jobs in your location of interest. Just enter your desired location and position and you are set!

## How was DuckEye created?

DuckEye was created using React as the front end and python as the backend.

## Lessons Learned

We learned a lot through this project. Many of us were new to hackathons so this was a great experience. Those who were new to hackathons were exposed to front and backend tasks challenges, while those who were more experienced were able to practice their skills. The creation of the backend was the most difficult part of the project and had a steep learning curve. Despite this, we were able to work together and finish the product!
